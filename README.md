NiteOwl for Android
====================
Back in the good old year 2014, my friend [Alex](http://alexanderkpage.com) got me on board with a new app idea called NiteOwl. It was a location-based social photo sharing app where you could capture photos and track locations you've been to with friends in a night, and relive the memories the next day - but everything would disappear after 24 hours. In the "X meets Y" paradigm, we described it as Snapchat meets Instagram (I guess we were focusing on location based concepts with the Instagram mention).  
There were grand plans that stretched even to doing geofencing promotions with bars, but unfortunately, several factors caused us not to see the project to completion. However, I like to think I made a good Android app out of it.

This is actually the second version of the Android app. If my memory serves right, the original was left behind for a while because it got frustrating to work on. I also made the silly decision to stick with Eclipse - this was mid 2015, just before the official deprecation for Android Studio.  
So on my own, I decided to build a second version that was a bit more lean and mean. I gave it the tagline **New hoot, new feathers, same owl attitude.** One of the higlights was the use of the Android Design Support Library which was released less than a month before starting this, and with the little amount of design work I did it was (IMO) better looking than the previous app. I didn't get the chance to implement the camera features, but almost all of the other funcitonality was accounted for.

There was also an iOS app, but I don't feel like it's worthwile to put up any ancient Swift 1.2 code.
